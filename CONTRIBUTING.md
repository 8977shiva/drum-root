# Contributing to Drum Root

## First steps

For your first PR please add your name to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/drum-root/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) file.

**Wanted : contributors!**  
Does the project appeal to you? Please view our [Trello boards](https://trello.com/drumroot/home) and grab a task! :smiley:

**We recognize all contributors**
Contributions can be:
Answering questions, bug reports, code, documentation, content, design, PR reviews, ideas & planning, translation, tests, tutorials, etc.

### When contributing to this repository, check the Trello board for available tasks.

### If the task is:

- **Available**: Go ahead and _claim the task_. You can assign it to yourself by editing your name into the card and moving it into the `Doing` column.
- **Claimed**: If someone else has claimed the task, speak with them or one of the project admin. _PRs will only be accepted from the person that claimed that task._
- **In Code Review**: Keep checking your PR in case a team member asks for some changes to be made.
- **Non-Existant**: If the feature does not appear on trello, _discuss it on Discord or speak with a project admin_.

The above is to ensure, everyone has the chance to get involved without waiting their time or rushing to add the feature.

## Adding Library

If you have any library that you want to use, please discuss it with the team first, as we want to avoid using different libraries that do the same thing.
