### When contributing to this repository, check the Trello board for available tasks.

### If the task is:

- **Available**: Go ahead and _claim the task_, and proceed to work on a PR
- **Claimed**: If someone else has claimed the task, speak with them or one of the project admin. _PRs will only be accepted from the person that claimed that task._
- **Non-Existant**: If the feature does not appear on trello, _discuss it on Discord or speak with a project admin_.

The above is to ensure, everyone has the chance to get involved without waiting their time or rushing to add the feature.

## Drum Root Process

### REFERENCE

Infos on technology and timeline, useful references for the team.

### Icebox

Backlog of pending items, which might mean:

- bugs,
- future planned features,
- blockers (meaning a particular task is holding everything else up, or the task doesn't need to be completed then and there),
- etc.

### Tasks Selected

Current things that are approved to work on and can be assigned or claimed.

### In Progress

Self-explanatory. Drag your task into this section, when you start working on it.
NOTE: Always create a new branch when working on a task!

### Review

This is where tasks are placed whilst the PR has been submitted and is awaiting approval. Once the code has been reviewed, it will be merged and the card can be archived.

## Contributing

We use Trello for task management. If you want to contribute, contact a project admin through Discord (we have a dedicated channel for the project **#drum-root**), an invitation to join the team on Trello we'll be given to you. Feel free to write the team some lines so the contributors get to know each other. Add your name on the CONTRIBUTORS.md list by doing the following steps:

1. Add the following command as a comment to your PR

```
@all-contributors please add <your-name> for <contributions>

```

2. Replace the <your-name> field with your Github username.

3. Replace the <contributions> field with the keyword based on the work you did. Every work done has its own emoji/contribution which can be easily understood and explained in the following link: https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key

For example, if user Test on Github has contributed to squashing some bugs, to add himself to the Contributors file he will use:

```
@all-contributors please add @Test for bug
```

4.  You're good to go! Enjoy

## Working on Code

- Pick a listed task from the **Tasks selected** area, assign it to yourself by editing your name into the card
- Or suggest a task on the #drum-root channel on Discord, that you can as well claim once approved, and start working on it
- If you want to work on an ongoing task, get permission from the person whose task is assigned to
- Fork the repo and work on dev branch
- Always let others in Discord know what you are working on

## Adding Library

If you have any library that you want to use, please discuss it with the team first, as we want to avoid using different libraries that do the same thing.
